Circular Primes
===========================================================

This simple applicacion get a number(X) and get the list of circular prime numbers between 1 and that number(X) in return.

For Optimization
----------------

1. Every time a list of prime numbers is searched, its result is saved in the database.
2. If the maximum number saved in the database is greater than the number we want to search, we only cut the circular primes ​​already saved in this register.
3. If the maximum number saved in the database is less than the number we want to search, we only look for the circular prime numbers from the maximum number saved in the database and not from 1.
